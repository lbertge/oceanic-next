# Oceanic-Next.vim

Oceanic-Next.vim is a neovim theme inspired by [Oceanic Next for Sublime](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme).
It is not a direct port, but uses some colors from the sublime theme, that are fitted to work with neovim and vim8.

This fork (based off [Oceanic-Next.vim](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next)) includes some slight tweaking for better Python syntax highlighting. 
This depends on
- [vim-easytags.vim](https://github.com/xolox/vim-easytags)

Installation is exactly the same.
